===================

The 15.1 Zero Trust Architecture shifts many of the objects that would exist in a per-session policy to the per-request policy thereby creating a more secure authentication and authorization scheme. The authenticity of each request is further enhanced through the use of F5â€™s Access Guard agent installed on a client.  This agent provides a PKI signed report of the posture assessment performed on the client real-time rather than the historical way plug-ins reported status. Previously, after a user connected to an application they would experience a delay in access as the agent performed the posture assessment to provide an unsigned report to the BIG-IP. 

This class covers the following topics related to Identity Aware Proxy:

- Real-time Posture Assessments
- Per-Request Frameworks
- Contextual Access
- HTTP Connector
