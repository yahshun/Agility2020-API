Module â€“ Create an Identity Aware Proxy
=============================================

.. TODO:: Needs module description

F5's Identity Aware Proxy(IAP) can be deployed a variety of ways.  In this lab you will deploy the IAP using the Guided Configuration(GC). GC allows an administrator to quickly configure and deploy an IAP without any advanced knowledge of APM Visual Policy Editor(VPE).  A policy that might take hours can be deployed in minutes simply by going through the 10 step process.
